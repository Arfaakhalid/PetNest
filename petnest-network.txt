PetNest Network is a web-based platform that connects everyone involved in pet adoption, rescue, and care. The system allows people to adopt, sell, or report stray animals easily in one place. It helps users find pets for adoption, shelters to manage rescued animals, vets to verify health details, and accessory stores to sell pet products. Reporters can report stray or injured animals by uploading photos and locations, which are then handled by nearby shelters. The platform also includes an online marketplace for pet accessories like food, toys, and medicines.
